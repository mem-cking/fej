        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Florida Environmental Justice (FEJ) Almanac Project. This project aims to map various environmental hazards and spatially join them to demographic data to highlight disparities in exposure to environmental pollutants across different communities in Florida.<p></p>
        <p>The first segment of this project includes geocoding Superfund sites and spatially joining them with demographic data in the state of Florida. The goal is to analyze the data to determine if the public health risks associated with proximity to superfund sites affects disadvantaged individuals and groups disproportionately. </p>
        <h2>What is Environmental Justice?</h2>
<p>Environmental Justice is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as “the just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people […] in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment.” (1). The term environmental justice became popularized when environmental injustices, in which individuals are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards, started coming to light (3). Since then the EPA has taken steps to mitigate, remediate, and reduce these environmental injustices, including the CERCLA and instituting advisory councils (2, 8, 10).</p>
